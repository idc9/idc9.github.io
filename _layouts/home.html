                <h3>Brief Bio</h3>


                Iain is an Assistant Professor of Pathology and Data Science at UNC-Chapel Hill working in <a href="https://pixelscientia.com/articles/">computational Pathology</a>. His <a href="/group.html">lab</a> builds data driven, computational systems to analyze high-resolution histology images of diseased tissue (e.g. digitized clinical H&E/IHC slides or multiplex immunofluorescence imaging) as well as other clinical data sources such as genetic testing and electronic health records.  Their aim is to develop artificial intelligence approaches that improve diagnostic precision, increase access to state of the art care for patients around the world, uncover novel biomarkers for disease prognosis/therapeutic response, and streamline the basic scientific investigation of disease processes. A major focus of the labâ€™s work is the development of novel machine learning approaches to address the scale and complexity of <a href="https://www.pixelscientia.com/article-finding-prognostic-patterns-in-gigapixel-images.html">histopathology images</a>, which are typically 10s-100s of thousands of pixels in dimension and take years of clinical training to interpret.

                Prior to coming (back) to UNC, Iain held visiting faculty positions in the Departments of Statistics at UC Berkeley and Pathology at UCSF. He completed a postdoc in the <a href="https://comp-path.bwh.harvard.edu/">Division of Computational Pathology</a> at Brigham and Women's Hospital/Harvard Medical School and an <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1902440&HistoricalAwards=false">NSF Mathematical Sciences</a> postdoctoral fellowship in the Department of Statistics at the University of Washington. He received a PhD in Statistics from UNC.
