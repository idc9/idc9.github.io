                <b>Brief Bio</b> <br>

                This fall I am starting a postdoc jointly at Memorial Sloan Kettering and Harvard Medical School in <a href="https://faisal.ai/"> Faisal Mahmood</a>â€™s computational oncology lab. Previously I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Statistics at the University of Washington hosted supported by the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1902440&HistoricalAwards=false">NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship</a>. I recieved a PhD in statistics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where I was advised by <a href="https://shankarbhamidi.web.unc.edu/">Shankar Bhamidi</a> and <a href="https://marron.web.unc.edu/">J.S Marron</a>.

                <br><br>Spanning methodology, theory, computation, and application my research develops statistical machine learning algorithms that discover interpretable results from data that have interesting structure such as networks, images, and multi-view data. My work is driven by applications coming from: genomics, medical imaging, computational neuroscience, and the law.
