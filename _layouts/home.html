                <b>Brief Bio</b> <br>

                I am a postdoc in <a href="https://faisal.ai/">Computational Pathology</a> at Harvard Medical School. Previously I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Statistics at the University of Washington supported by the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1902440&HistoricalAwards=false">NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship</a>. I received a PhD in statistics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where I was advised by <a href="https://shankarbhamidi.web.unc.edu/">Shankar Bhamidi</a> and <a href="https://marron.web.unc.edu/">J.S Marron</a>.

                <br><br>
                My research is centered on data with a complex structure such as networks, images, and multi-view data. Driven by biomedical applications, my work develops statistical machine learning algorithms to learn interpretable insights from these kinds of complex data types. Recent projects have focused on high-dimensional regression, structured sparsity, addiction medicine, and the analysis of very large medical imaging data such as <a href="https://www.pixelscientia.com/article-finding-prognostic-patterns-in-gigapixel-images.html">H&E stained whole slide images</a> from pathology.
