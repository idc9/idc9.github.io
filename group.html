We are an interdisciplinary group from UC Berkeley and UCSF working in <a href="https://pixelscientia.com/articles/">computational pathology</a>. A major focus of the group is on the vast amounts of high-resolution spatial-omics data that are starting to be generated in Pathology laboratories such as digitized H&E stained slides, multiplex immunofluorescence, spatially resolved transcriptomics, and 3D histology data. The scale and complexity of these data (e.g. <a href="https://www.pixelscientia.com/article-finding-prognostic-patterns-in-gigapixel-images.html">whole slide images</a> are typically 100,000 x 100,000 pixels and take years of medical training to interpret) mean new statistical/machine learning algorithms need to be developed to fully harness the promise of these emerging tissue measurement technologies.

Linking these different tissue-based data modalities together with electronic health record information presents significant opportunities for discovery, but poses major statistical and computational challenges. The computational arm of our work weaves together high-dimensional statistics, network analysis, deep learning, computer vision, and open-source software to solve these challenging biomedical data analysis problems. The scientific arm of our work aims to improve clinical practice through the use of data-driven methods to understand disease development,  discover biomarkers, improve diagnosis, and predict response to therapeutics.
