In addition to research, I am committed to making modern, computational methods more accessible to statisticians and scientists, as well as those without a traditional STEM background. During my time at UNC I created and taught the first <a href="https://idc9.github.io/stor390/">data science course</a> offered by the Statistics Department, which is now a permanent part of the curriculum.
